# DevMountain Angular I

## Intro
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi all, I'm Leon Gaban, frontend developer for the Dallas based startup [TickerTags.com](https://tickertags.com)

All day I work with design files, write markup and CSS and develope Angular based Single Page Applications. Right now I'm using Angular and the Ionic framework to develop mobile app. So frontend development can expands into more areas than it use too, the skills we're all developing is basically the skills to craft user experiences.

I'm 100% self-taught, I went to school for art and design not computer science, learned everything I know now online through tuts+, teamtreehouse, codeacademy, etc etc... I wish there was a bootcamp option like this for me back in the day, I would have jumped on it.

We're builders, backend developers create the foundation, wire up the electricity and water. Frontend developers put up the walls, paint them, install windows, style doors, handles, put in the bushes and flowers. We make shit look pretty, functional and work smoothly... and full stack developers do it all.

# jQuery & Angular

What are the differences between jQuery and Angular?

First both are Javascript frameworks, frameworks abstract complexity from languages. What we write is Javascript, however building apps in pure vanilla Javascript is a pain in the ass. Frameworks help us by refining the language so it can be used easier in a concise way to accomplish specific things.

The jQuery framework is a framework designed to allow us to easily manipulate the DOM, the HTML Markup. We can grab elements, like divs, p tags, H1s, etc and move them around, change their css classes, animate things, etc.

Now as things have evolved, developers aren't so much making websites anymore as we're making apps in a variety of spaces. And this is what the Angular framework specializes in, Angular helps us create Single Page Applications.

# SPAs Single Page Applications.

## What problems do SPAs help us solve?
  - They provide a smooth, intuitive user experience
  - Apps are fully downloaded, and only make requests to the server for relevant data
  - We're in the age of apps not web pages anymore. Forcing page refreshes is the old way of doing things.

# Angular Directives

## What is an Angular directive?

An Angular directive is an Angular module whose purpose is to interact with the DOM, controllers manipulate $scopes and data, services connect controllers to other controllers and directives and retrieves data from servers. Directives render, represent and attaches specific behavior the views of our apps.

## What types of Angular directives exist?
  - Elements
  - Attributes
  - Classes
  - Comments

Classes and Comments are very rarely used, in fact I would suggest not worrying about Classes or Comments, those may already be deprecated. The most used directives in Angular are Elements and Attributes.

An example of an element directive is a custom HTML tag such as <tags-panel></tags-panel> or <overlay></overlay>

## Element directives
Will be how you build and arrange the foundation of your app. Using a house analogy again, Element directives is how you know do the walls go, the kitchen, doors etc.

## Attribute directives
What are some examples of Angular attribute directives?

  - ng-repeat
  - ng-show
  - ng-hide
  - ng-click
  - ng-model
  - ng-app
  - ng-class

You can write your own custom attribute directives to solve very specific problems, in my experience I've only had to [write 1 so far](https://gist.github.com/leongaban/9512645ab01e74bb0663).
